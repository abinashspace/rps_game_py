What I Learned From Building This Simple Game
---------------------------------------------

- Used functions to organize different parts of the game.
- Applied variables to keep track of scores and moves.
- Managed data with a list (for moves) and a dictionary (for emojis).
- Handled decisions using if/elif/else statements for win/tie/lose outcomes.
- Generated random moves for the computer with random.choice().
- Created a simple GUI using Tkinter (buttons, labels, window layout).
- Connected button clicks to functions for interactive play.
- Updated scores and results live after each move.
- Practiced basic version control by uploading and sharing my code on GitHub.
- These basics are the real skills I gained from making this project.
